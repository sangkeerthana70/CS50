In your own words discuss Binary and its impact:

Bi means two which represents 0 and 1 which the computer can understand. They represent the two states either 0 or 1.
By having two digits 0 and 1 we can represent things much  more powerfully and efficiently.

They are represented with the base 2.

Decimal  binary   Conversion
0	  =	  0	      0 ( 2^0 )
1	  =	  001	  1 ( 2^0 )
2	  =	  010	  1 ( 2^1 ) + 0 ( 2^0 )
3	  =   011	  1 ( 2^1 ) + 1 ( 2^0 )
4	  =	  100	  1 ( 2^2 ) + 0 ( 2^1 ) + 0 ( 2^0 )
5	  =	  101	  1 ( 2^2 ) + 0 ( 2^1 ) + 1 ( 2^0 )
6     =   110
7     =   111
8     =   0111 (Here  we add a 0 in the front which is the equivalent of adding a bit)

Using this binary code we can map it to represent letters as well. This mapping is defined in ASCII code.

The binary code assigns a pattern of binary digits (bits) to each character, instruction, etc. For example, a binary string of eight bits can represent any of 256 possible values and can therefore represent a variety of different items.
The following is an example of how letters are stored in the computer.
HI! == 72 73 33 in ASCII
Thus binary system helps  store large volumes of data efficiently.




In your own words discuss Algorithms as was introduced:

Algorithms are
Step by step instructions, that will help solve a problem.
Using algorithms we can write computer programs and analyse the expected and unexpected scenarios when solving a problem.
They help in breaking down problems into their constituent parts.
When we methodically express the steps in the algorithm we create a Psudocode.

Pseudocode to look up a name in phone book.

0 pick up phone book
1 open to middle of phone book
2 look at names
3 if Smith is among names - (here -if- is a construct by which we are questioning ourselves)
4	call  Mike              (notice the indentation which means only if line-3 is true execute line4)
5 else if Smith is earlier in book
6	open to middle of left half of book
7	go back to step 2
8 else if Smith is later in book
9 	open to middle of right half of book
10	go back to step 2
11else
12	quit -(address this scenario when Smith is not there totally else the program will crash)

The above algorithm is recursive which means the steps in the code gets repeated over and
over again until the solution is reached.

Hacking Algorithm
New Hacking algorithms have been developed with advanced capabilities to penetrate even secure
enterprises. This has created serious challenges to all organizations, which spend a vast
amount of time and energy to build additional layers of security and monitoring. It also has
created additional concerns for individuals who share personal information in social media.
Recent example was the revelation that personal data of millions of Facebook users were
illegally used by a political consultancy firm called Cambridge Analytica, which potentially
helped one presidential candidate over the other in the recent US election.
